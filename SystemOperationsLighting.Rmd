# Introduction
This document provides basic operating information for each of the major AV systems at Unionville Alliance Church.

Purpose of the lighting system:

* Necessary to help the hearing impaired ( roughly 10% of the population) to lip read
* Supports video recording
* Helps draw attention to the central item – conversely makes it easier to ignore clutter
* Helps audience to focus and concentrate
* Reinforces the message (spoken or sung)

There are two mechanisms to control the lighting: 

* A touch panel located on the main floor by the south east auditorium doors. Users can select one of several preset configurations. 
* For more sophisticated control, The primary lighting control console  is an ETC ColorSource 40AV console.  It is used for all lighting operations more sophisticated than can be accomplished via the touchpad panel.

#Sunday Morning  Rundown

>TODO: This section will need to be modified after we finish the installation.

>TODO: fix indentation errors in the Details column in the below table. 

These are the steps to follow for a normal Sunday morning.


```{r rundown}
p <- "Lights"
activities %>%
       filter(Who == p) %>%
        mutate(Time = num2time(Time1)) %>%
        replace_na(list(Details="", How="",

#The Functions of Light

Stage lighting has multiple functions, including:

Selective visibility
: The ability to see what is occurring on stage. Any lighting design will be ineffective if the viewers cannot see the characters, unless this is the explicit intent.

Revelation of form
: Altering the perception of shapes onstage, particularly three-dimensional stage elements.

Focus
: Directing the audience's attention to an area of the stage or distracting them from another.

Mood
: Setting the tone of a scene. Harsh red light has a different effect than soft lavender light.

Location and time of day
: Establishing or altering position in time and space. Blues can suggest night time while orange and red can suggest a sunrise or sunset. Use of mechanical filters ("gobos") to project sky scenes, the Moon, etc.

Projection/stage elements
: Lighting may be used to project scenery or to act as scenery onstage.
Plot (script): A lighting event may trigger or advance the action onstage and off.

Composition
: Lighting may be used to show only the areas of the stage which the designer wants the audience to see, and to "paint a picture".[4][5]

Effect
: In pop and rock concerts or DJ shows or raves, colored lights and lasers may be used as a visual effect.

#The Qualities of Light

##Intensity

The intensity of a luminaire (lighting instrument or fixture) depends on a number of factors including its lamp power, the design of the instrument (and its efficiency), optical obstructions such as colour gels or mechanical filters, the distance to the area to be lit and the beam or field angle of the fixture, the colour and material to be lit, and the relative contrasts to other regions of illumination.

[Back to top](#top)

##Color

Every color has some kind of emotion tied to it, and color is just one way that we can express mood. There are some generally accepted relationships between moods and feelings and basic colors:

Red
: Anger, fear, jealousy, hot, fire

Pink
: Love, light, delicate, love

Yellow
: Exciting, bright, flashy, cheerful

Amber
: Awakening, morning, raw, rustic

Green
: Organic, calming, natural, mysterious

Purple
: Regal, powerful, majesty
 
Aqua
: Gentle, simple, water

Blue
: Water, night, calm, cool, somber

White
: Open, raw

This is a very simplified way of sharing moods with you, as there are so many more shades that each have their own character and moods. For example faster songs tend to go best in red, yellow, or other bright colors, and slower songs look great in blues, purples and greens.

There are entire books written on colour theory and their emotional effects. We also have the ability to mix colours together which adds even more nuance to our decisions. You can choose a completely monochromatic theme, say varied shades of blue. Or a 2-colour combo using complimentary colours, such as blue and yellow. Or Triadic colors, which are like complementary colors, but in a triangle across the color wheel.

Whatever your colour choices, it is best if there is agreement bewteen the lighting colours and the colours used in the video backgrounds.

[Back to top](#top)

##Focus

The focus is where an instrument is pointed. The final focus should place the "hot spot" of the beam at the actor's head level when standing at the centre of the instrument's assigned "focus area" on the stage. Position refers to the location of an instrument in the theater's fly system or on permanent pipes in front-of-house locations. Hanging is the act of placing the instrument in its assigned position.

[Back to top](#top)

##Beam

Beam refers to the shape, quality and evenness of a lamp's output. The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by a number factors about the instruments design.

Some instruments can have a gobo or break up pattern installed. This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. Gobos, or templates, come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.

# Lighting Power Control

> This section needs to be rewritten post the 2018 upgrades.

## Power On

#. Turn on 'Furhman' unit under rear desk / east end - big red switch
    + As of the Fall 2017, this is to be left on at all times. This is temporary as I work through a configuration problem.
#. ensure that only one control cable is plugged in either to the express console or the computer interface.    
#. Go to closet
#. Turn on power bar in closet (scroller power). This is very important.
#. Turn on big switch up high
#. Double check that the scrollers have power (little red light on the scroller). If they don't have power, then using the lights will melt the GEL strings. This is bad.
#. Wait five minutes for the warm-up macro to run.
#. Before running the light you must enure that the red lights on the bottom of the scrollers is on. If not the #3 in the power on sequence might have been skipped. The scrollers will be damaged if those light are not on.

> It is very important to ensure the scroller power is on.

## Power Off

#. To turn off, reverse the order and turn off.

> When leaving the system for the day ensure that the control cable is connected to the epxress console (and not the computer.)

#Controlling the Lighting System - New
> Effective once the 2018 lighting upgrades are complete.

Basic operations of the house lights can be accomplished by using the touchpad are the front of the auditorium (office side doors). One of several scenes can be selected. However, once the main lighting console is turned on, it takes over control of the system and this panel is disabled. See the section below for more details.

Advanced operations of house and theatre lighting is acccomplished via the lighting console in the balcony. See the section below for more details.

#Operating the ColorSource 40AV Console

In the August 2018 we will be installing a new lighting console. This will replace our current complicated solution consisting of the old Express console during the week, the computer program on Sunday morning, and the brown box for the house lights. The new console will be able to control all of that and more.

##Learning

There are 20 videos in the ColorSource Video Learning Series. The model we will have is the ColorSource 40AV. This list of videos is tagged into three categories: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced.  

The "User Manual" is available on the [manufacturer's website](https://www.etcconnect.com/Support/Consoles/ColorSource/Documentation.aspx) 

[ColorSource Video Learning Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-Ao0hIFwH-KC5-CK9VrAvZCP2YynH1X)

The videos are all numbered (TitleNumber) on the web site, but that is not the best order to watch them in for our purpose. The Seqeunce is a better choice.

```

##Simple Console Operations
In our standard settings, we use the *playback* mode to run our basic scenes. You must be in playback mode for this to work. A quick check is to look at the numbered buttons below the faders; if they are a pale purple and green then you are in the right mode. 

There is a button on the left side of the screen that you touch to select playback mode; the yellow arrow in the picture below points at it.

![Playback Mode - The yellow arrow points at the button](../../images/sol-cs40-playback.png)

Also the playback master must be up. It is the second slider from the left at the top of the screen. 

![Playback Master Fader - The yellow arrow points at the button Playback master](../../images/sol-cs40av-pb-master.jpg)

The first 5 sliders (#21-#26) on the bottom row are programmed to looks that are useful for a simple service. These sliders (as well as others) can be used in combination to build a look.

```{r simple}
playback %>%
  #arrange(Playback) %>%
  filter(IsSimple =="Y") %>%
  select(-IsSimple) %>%
  kable() %>%
  column_spec( 1,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

[Back to top](#top)

##Intermediate Console Operations

The other playback faders are used to control individual groups of lights. The first six have a designated special purpose for sound triggers.

> Consider swapping Towers and Sconce.

There are terms used in these descirptions to describe areas of the room that you need to know.

Flares
: similar in location to the towers, these are cone shaped lights which can be used to provide a contrasting overlay to the towers.

House
: All Pendants plus the under balcony pot lights

Sconce
: The wall mounted fixtures that light the outer aisles

Scrim
: portable white translucent panels on stage - currently white

Stage Pots
: The lights recessed mounted into the ceiling of the stage

Towers
: These are wide pillars of light that wash up the walls beside the screens

Wall Wash
: These are the ceiling mounted perimeter lights that wash down the walls including the bulkhead sideways wash.

All of these have a group of three playbacks that are programmed for RGB. This provides an easy way to set the colour of that entire group by adjsuting the relative blend of red, green and blue.

Some of the playback groups, for example the House, also have a fourth slider which is straight white. This is a quick way of getting to white for that group. 

```{r intermediate}
playback %>%
#  arrange(Playback) %>%
  select(-IsSimple) %>%
  kable() %>%
  column_spec( 1:2,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

##Operating the Keypad

There is a simple lighting control panel located in the Usher's room. It enables the house lights to set according to several pre-defined looks. 

> These looks are ideas. The final set has to be no more than 5.


```{r keypad}
keypad <- tribble(
  ~Number, ~Name, ~Description,

  1, "Off", "Off",
  2, "Security", "A subset of lights on medium (sconce plus maybe some of the house lights)",
  3, "Basic", "Front centre lit bright - rest of room medium - funerals / weddings plus some accents",
  4, "BSF", "More light Downlight On stage - otherwise #4",
  5, "Sconce only", "(Might be redundant with 2)",
  6, "Auditorium House", "Auditorium House lights full White",
  7, "Stage lights",  "Stage lights full white",
  8, "Janitor", "Most everything on full white (stage ketra plus house): 6+7"
)

keypad %>%
  arrange(Number) %>%
  kable() %>%
  column_spec( 1,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

**Keypad operations are diabled when the main console is powered on. **

# Blinds and Shades

We have two ways of controlling the light the enters the sanctuary via the exterior windows: semi-transparent shades and blackout blinds.

### Shade Operation

The shades are operated manually. There is a chrome chain in each window which runs the shade up or down.  

### Blind Operation

The blackout blinds operate on four banks of three blinds (one bank per wall). The switches are under the second desk near the computer.
They are labelled: SE, NE, SW, and NW, which stands for the combinations of South, East, North and West.

Each switch has three positions: Up, center and down. The Up and Down positions move the blinds in that direction. Centre is ‘off’, but does not stop a blind mid-way. When a blind is set to move in a direction it will do so until it is fully up or fully down. There are internal limit switches that will stop the blind at the limit. The switch does not have to be returned to the centre position.

To stop a blind mid-way while travelling, momentarily flick the switch in the opposite direction and then return the switch to centre. If you pause too long in the opposite direction the blind will reverse direction rather than stop.

When the service is over, please ensure that the blinds are all the way up. If left down for long periods of time in the bright daylight, heat builds up between the blind and the window and the blind deforms and pops out of the track.

### Troubleshooting

If a blind pops out of its track. 
: Running the blinds up and down a **little** bit at a time can sometimes get them back in their track. An assistant at the blind can reach in behind and help guide them in. If it is more than a few inches, a ladder may be required to reinsert the blind into the track.

If the playbacks do not seem to work
: Two things to check. 1) ensure you are in playback mode and that the playback master is up. See Instructions in the Simple Console Operations section.

# Appendix

## Lighting Terminology

Channel
: In the context of lighting at UAC, a channel is a configuration item in the colorSource console. It controls one to many DMX addresses. If the console knows what kind of instrument a channel is assigned to, it is automatically configured for the correct behaviours (colour, strobe, etc). 

Dimmmer
: A device which regulates the power sent to a lighting instrument (typically incandescent) this allows the intensity of the instrument to be varied. Usually DMX controlled, but could be controlled via an analog or proprietary protocols.

DMX / DMX512
: an industry standard lighting control protocol. A universe is a group of 512 addresses, numbered 1 through 512. See also RDM. 

Gel
: a coloured sheet of special plastic which is used to physically change the colour of a light. 

Gel Frame
: a metal or heat-resistant cardboard frame to hold a Gel and slips into a slot on the lighitng instrument.

Gobo
: a pattern, usually made from thin metal or glass, which enables a lighting instrument to project a pattern. Usually slips in the a Gobo frame which slides into the instrument. 

Incandescent
: a method of producing light by heating a filament (thin wire) inside a glass bulb. A standard old-fashioned lightbulb is incandescent. See Also LED.

LED / Light Emitting Diode
: A technology that generates lighting from a solid state device rather than a hot piece of wire (incandecent). An LED instrument also typically has built in dimming and control control. They typically use 3 to 5 DMX channels. See aslo Incandescent.

Par / Par Can
: a type of lighting instrument with a fixed beam width. Some of them look like paint cans. Generally used for washes.

Rotator
: a device which spins a Gobo. Inserted into a lighting instrument where the Gobo holder would go - usually.

Top Hat
: a light modifier added to the front of a lighting instrument to narrow its beam spread.

#Appendix

#Operating QLC+ (Computer based)

QLC+ is a free software based lighting control platform that offers many useful features. 

We are currently running the software on the VideoMac (CDMU-A002). The software is free so you could install it at home and learn how to use it. [Download here.](http://www.qlcplus.org/)

The following is written based on V4 of the software. (Version 5 will be a major change some point in the future.)

There are some good videos that give a pretty good overview:

#. The Offical Tutorial
: These can be found [here](http://www.qlcplus.org/tutorials.html). Tutorials #1,2 and #4 are most relevant to what we do.

#. User Interface specific
: [This](https://youtu.be/a7Arrx7XrRs) one covers the interface from the perspective of the Virtual Console.

The primary interface is the Virtual Console. QLC+ allows complete customization of what that interface looks like. What we operate is different than what you will see in the tutorials because it is customized to what we want and need. 

Our current interface design is oriented towards simple operations where we have a handful of presets that select as the service progresses.

Along the bottom of the screen there is a row of tabs that change the aspect of the program you are working with. One the screen they look like this, the active tabe is blue.

![Tabs](../../images/sol-qlc-tabs.png)

The purpose of each is:

Fixtures
: Defines the characteristcis of each fixture. For example, the DMX channel number assignment. For a simple dimmer, there would be only one. For a more sophisticated LED fixture there could be lots.

Functions
: Functions are groupings of fixtures with set channel levels for each included fixture. it can also include a fade-in and fade-out time. We assign functions to buttons on the virtrual console.

Shows
: We won't be using this normally

Virtual Console
: The virtual console is configured by us to suit our operational needs. This is the area we use most. It has its own section below.

Simple Desk
: The simple desk provides a slider for every channel. We don't typically operate the system from here, but sometimes it is handy for setup or trouble shooting. If you find a light that won't go off, check to make sure it is not being forced on from the simple desk.

Input/Outputs
: In normal operation we wont need to use this but may if we need to trouble shoot a problem.


We will know go into several of them in detail, starting with what we use most.

##Virtual Console

![The Virtual Console Tab](../../images/sol-qlc-tabs.png)

We have configured our virtual console to be mostly buttons. Each button is associated with a function, and a function is a collection of settings. Functions will be discussed in detail below.

When a button is active, it will have a green border around it. (Or it could be orange - when a function is linked to two buttons the one that is clicked will be green, and the other will be orange.)

###Design and Operate Mode

In the upper right of the screen you will see a row of controls that look like this:

![Design mode - green triangle will transition to Operate](../../images/sol-qlc-controls1.png)

or this:

![Operate mode - red sqaure will transition to Run](../../images/sol-qlc-controls2.png)

The difference is the very last control. The presence of the green triangle indicates you are in design mode, and clicking that control will take you into operate mode. Think of the green arrow as 'play' - ready to go.

The presence of the red button indicates you are in operate mode. This is the mode that you would be in most of the time during a service. Pressing the red square says 'stop' and places you back into design mode.

Swithing back to design mode will not affect the current lighting look.

###Frames
The buttons are grouped inside frames, some frames are red and others are black. The frame colour tells you how the buttons will behave.

Red Frames
: These are called solo frames. Only one button at a time can be active (green border). When one button in a solo frame is active and another one in the same frame is pushed, it will dectivate the former button (like old fashioned car radios).

Black Frames
: Multiple buttons can active at the same time.



###Expanding and collapsing frames

Frames can be expanded and collapsed. This is useful for frames you don't always want to be visible on the screen. Clicking this icon will toggle the expanded or contracted view.
  
![This is what the expand / collapse icon looks like.](../../images/sol-qlc-expand.png)

###Enabling and disabling a frame

A frame's function can be disabled completely. This is useful if you want to prevent an accidental click on a function you don't need at the moment or if it is an automated function you want to turn off - for example an audio trigger.

![This is the enable / disable icon. It has a green shade when enabled.](../../images/sol-qlc-enable.png)

[Back to top](#top) 

##Functions

![The functions tab ](../../images/sol-qlc-functions.png)

The functions tab is the second most used tab within the program. You would use this mosly when setting up a service. At UAC is is mostly used for defining scenes.

Within the main window there is the Scenes hierachy of objects. 

![scenes](../../images/sol-qlc-function-scene.png)

Within that there will be folders of scene defintions. There are a few folders for generic things, for exmaple there is one called "Preset Scenes", and there are others which have been created for specfic events. 

![The Preset Scenes Group](../../images/sol-qlc-preset-scenes.png)

When selecting one of those items, a window opens up at the bottom which has all of settings for that scene, which can be a lot.

This is what one of them coould look like (This is one called "PS 1 Walkin").

![Sample Scene](../../images/sol-qlc-scene-general.png)

There is a whole row of icons across the top. The purpose of each of those, that matter to us, will be breifly discussed. 
 
![Enables or Disables Channels](../../images/sol-qlc-scene-enable.png) 
 
When a fixtures is selected, these icons allow you to activate (or deactivate) the channels for the selected fixture. You can observe this behaviour by looking at the row of checkboxes above each slider.
 
![Fixture selector](../../images/sol-qlc-functions-scene-arrows.png) 

This is a shortcut to step across the list of fixtures.

![The Timer](../../images/sol-qlc-functions-timer.png)

Clicking on the clock icon pops up the timer details.

The timer is a commonly used feature. By default, when a function is activated it happens instantly. Likewise when turn it off. The timer lets us define transition times to make them more gradual. A good rule of thumb is 5 seconds is slow enough that it will be hardly noticed. 

You cane set the "fade in" and "fade out" times independently.

The detailed settings are shown below.

![Timer Details](../../images/sol-qlc-functions-timerdetail.png)

![Preview](../../images/sol-qlc-scene-preview.png)

>To be written. 

![Fixture Details](../../images/sol-qlc-scene-fixture-details.png)

>To be written

[Back to top](#top) 

##Fixtures

![Fixtures Tab](../../images/sol-qlc-tab-fixtures.png)

This is where we define all of the lighting instruments we have installed and since that doesn't change often we don't need to use it often.

You might refer to this section if you are trying to follow the configurtation. 

"*Fixture Groups*" and "*Channel Groups*" are two kinds of configurations that are defined here, there is a toggle which allows you to choose which you are working with. 

**Fixture Groups**

![Fixture Groups Selected](../../images/sol-qlc-fixtures-fgroups.png)

This is the defintion of each individual fixture. Select one to see the overview of the defintion. The key peice of information you would typical want is the "Address Range" and "Channel" information. More information can be see by using the "Wrench and Screwdriver" icon to see the properties details.

**Channel Groups**

![Channel Groups Selected](../../images/sol-qlc-fixtures-cgroups.png)

Channel Groups are useful to group together similar channels from several fixtures to operate as a unit. For example if we want all light bars to behave the same we could define a channel group. 

There is a trade-off between using the individual fixtures in a function and a channel group, particularly with RGB fixtures. When using the individual fixutres you can set the colour using the palette icon in the scene editor. If a channel group is used, you lose that feature and you have to set the colours manually.

**Other Controls**

![Add and Remove Buttons](../../images/sol-qlc-fixtures-main.png)

Use the "+" or "-" to add or remove a fixture or a channel group. Use the "wrench and screwdriver" to make changes.

[Back to top](#top) 

##Simple Desk

![Simple Desk Tab](../../images/sol-qlc-tab-simple.png)

The Simple Desk provides a slider for each channel. You would typically not want to run a show this way, instead it is most useful to test a lamp or a connection in isolation. If you modify a level on the simple desk, that strip will turn red. You need to remember to click the "X" at the bottom of the strip to release control. If you run across a scenario where a light seems to be stuck on, check the Simple Desk. There is likely a "red" strip with a set level.

[Back to top](#top) 

##Input/Output

![Input/Output Tab](../../images/sol-qlc-tab-io.png)
