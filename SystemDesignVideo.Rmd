# Introduction
This document provides key technical documentation for the video recording and broadcasting subsystems at UAC. This diagram provides an overview of the major components and leaves out some details.

```{r}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology0-overview.gv")
```

Frequently throughout this document there will be a diagram or description of some aspect of the installation and following that a listing of the mentioned equipment which provide more detail on the mentioned assets.

Every significant inventory item is to have an asset tag - an actual label attached to the device. For the AV gear these tags all start with a Z. For example ZVKU-A001 is the assest tag of the kramer video matrix.

# Presentation Switcher
The unit is a Kramer VS-88DT which is an 8x8 matrix and can handle both HDMI and HDBaseT formats.

It has 8 inputs and 8 outputs. It can be controlled via the buttons on the front panel or from itâ€™s built in web page.

```{r}
psi <- tribble(
  ~Input, ~Usage,       ~Comment,

1, "TW Left",       "Tripple wide input Left (from PP via fx4)" ,
2, "TW Centre",     "Tripple wide input Centre (from PP via fx4)", 
3, "TW Right",      "Tripple wide input Right (from PP via fx4)",
4, "Confidence",    "Stage display from PP. Meant for the rear projector.",
5, "VMIX Program",  "Program output from Video Mixer",
6, "VMIX AUX",      "Aux output from Video Mixer.",
7, "CDWU-0009",     "Video Output from Windows machine. Usually used for OBS.",
8, "Lighting Console", "This input could also be used for a guest machine." 
)

pso <- tribble(
    ~Output, ~Usage,       ~Comment,
1,
"FoH Prj Left", 
"Front of House projector - East wall",
2, 
"FoH Prj Centre",
"Front of House projector - South wall",
3, 
"FoH Prj Right",
"Front of House projector - West wall",
4,
"Confidence",
"Rear Balcony Projector (stage display from PP). Lyrics for singers, etc.",
5,
"Video Mix 1",
"Video mixer input 1",
6,
"Video Mix 3",
"Video mixer input 3",
7,
"Lobby",
"Feed to the Lobby TV.",
8,
"Nursery",
"Feed to the Nursery TV."   
)
```

##Inputs

```{r}
psi %>% 
  kable() %>%
    column_spec( 1,  bold = TRUE ) %>%
    kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

##Outputs
```{r}
pso %>% 
  kable() %>%
    column_spec( 1,  bold = TRUE ) %>%
    kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

##Configurations
The LCD display on the front of the unit report the current routing topology. The Output row shows the number of the input which is selected for that output. A '0' indicated no source has been selected. Here are two sample configurations.  

#### Normal Service Switcher Configuration 
The display should look like:

|Input |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Output|1|0|0|4|1|1|1|0|

```{r normal}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-PSnormal.gv", height=300)
```

#### Camera Switcher Configuration  
The display should look like:

|Input |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|-|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Output|6|0|0|4|6|0|6|0|

```{r camera}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-PScamera.gv", height=300)
```

# Topologies
There are a lot of components to the system. One big diagram is daunting. It has been broken down into smaller portions to be more consumable. 

## Computer Topology

There are three computers in the system:

CDWU-0009 Windows / OBS / Mediashout
: This windows 7 system has a dual output video card. One is used for the operator display, and the second for presentation. It normally runs OBS to drive the secondary output typically just for the pre-service announcement loop. It also has Mediashout instaled but rarely used. And it has Powerpoint for Windows installed.

CDMU-A001 MacOS / ProPresenter
: This system runs ProPresenter and has a built in operator display, and a displayport output to the datapath video processor which split the output to three separate video signals for the front projectors, and a separate video output that drives the rear confidence montitor. It also has Powerpoint for Mac and Keynote installed.

CDMU-A002 MacOS / ATEM / OBS / Propresenter
: This system runs the ATEM switcher software, and OBS (for streaming) and can also run things like Skype. It has a USBC-HDMI adapter that is direct connected to Input 2 of the video mixer.

>todo: Confirm web presenter SDI and HDMI inputs.
>todo: is the monitor for CDWU-0009 a vga monitor? 
>todo: label and document the sdi<>hmdi boxes
  
```{r top1}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology1-computer.gv")
print_inv(c("CDWU-0009","CDMU-A001","CDMU-A002", "ZLKU-B001",
            "ZVKU-A003", "ZVKU-A001", "ZVIU-A004", "ZVKU-A002"
            ), Tech_Inventory)
```

## Projection Topology
There are four projectors in the auditorium, three FoH and one at the rear for confidence. Thet are all feed an hdmi signal via HDBaseT (Over Cat6).

```{r top2}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology2-projection.gv")
print_inv(c("ZVKU-A001","ZVVU-A001", "ZVVU-A002", "ZVVU-A003", "ZVVU-0001"),                    Tech_Inventory)
```

##Lobby Topology
The TV in the lobby gets its content from the presentation Switcher. For the main service it should get its feed from the video mixer program output.

```{r l132}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology3-lobby.gv")

print_inv(c("ZVIU-A002", "ZVKU-A001", "ZVVU-0002"), Tech_Inventory)
```

>TODO: document the swap of the lobby and nursery TV. ZVVU-0002 is now in the lobby. ZVVU-0003 is in the nursery. Diagrams and charts have been updated - need to update the inventory database with the new locations.

## Nursery Topology
The TV in the nursery gets its content from the presentation Switcher. For the main service it should get its feed from the video mixer program output.

```{r top3}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology4-nursery.gv")
print_inv(c("ZVIU-A001", "ZVKU-A001",   "ZVVU-0003"), Tech_Inventory)
```

The TV has a remote control.

## Recording / Livestream Topology
The recording topology is quite complex and so it is broken up into peices.

###Inputs

```{r top5a}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology5-rec-inputs.gv", height=350)
```

###Outputs
```{r top5b}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology5-rec-outputs.gv", height=350)
```

###Web Presenter
There are some details on the signal path between the Video Mixer and the Web Presenter that need to be documented.

```{r topwp}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdv-topology6-rec-wp.gv", height=350)
```

```{r}
print_inv(c("ZVKU-A004", "ZVKU-A001", "CDMU-A002", "ZVCU-A001",
           "ZVCU-A002", "ZVCU-A003", "ZVKU-A003",
           "ZVRU-A001", "ZVRU-A002", "ZVIU-A004"), Tech_Inventory)
```

#Camera Settings

The cameras recall their settings for preset 1 when powered on. This includes the video settings documented here. You should not need to adjust these regularly. If you need to reference the procedure to adjust the camera settings, see the Video system desgin guide.

Each camera has a web page where we can make these updates. Open Safari and then for each camera do these steps:

#. Enter the address for a camera in the address bar. They will be on the left bookmark bar but if not, listed here as well.
```{r addresses}
network.data  %>% 
  filter(AssetTag %in% c("ZVCU-A001","ZVCU-A002","ZVCU-A003")) %>% 
  select( AssetTag, URL , Notes ) %>%
    kable(align="l") %>%
    column_spec( 1,  bold = TRUE ) %>%
    kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

#. At the top of the page, click on "Setting" and the on the left "Video" and the "Picture" tab
    * You should **not** be challenged for a userid and password, but if you are skip these steps and let Terry know.
#. Change Exposure Mode to "Iris Priority" 
    * This instructs the camera to we are going to set the lens aperture (Iris) otherselves, and the camera will control the other exposure settings. 
#. Change Exposure Compensatoin to "-4"
    * This instructs the camera to make the image a little bit darker than it thinks it should be. We are trying to get good face exposure.
#. Change Iris to "F1.6"
    * This forces the camera to take in the maximum amount of light.
#. Change White balance Mode to "Indoor"
    * This tells the camera that the lighting will tend to be a warmer shade than standard daylight. (There is a "Standard"). The default make skin tones too orange.
#. Change High Resolution mode to "On"
    * Use the maximum resolution the camera is capable of.
#. Change Aperture to "0"
    * Maximum light 
#. At the bottom of the page, click the "Ok" button. 
    * You will be able to see the chnages take effect.

Here is a screenshot of the page with the settings applied.
