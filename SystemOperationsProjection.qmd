# Introduction

This document provides basic operating information for the main video projection system at Unionville Alliance Church.

Our projection system is quite flexible and allows for numerous video sources to be connected to many display devices (including projectors and TVs).

ProPresenter is the primary tool we use for display lyrics, message support graphics, announcements and other such visuals. The ProPresenter visuals are also used to broadcast and record our services, which is managed by the video crew.

At times you will also need to change the video routing for special features such as baptism.

# ProPresenter Training Videos

The firm that makes ProPresenter, Renewed Vision, has many great training videos on their [web site](https://www.renewedvision.com/propresenter.php?page=tour).

They have been organized in the list below, @fig-training-videos, into basic, intermediate and advanced topics.

```{r training}
#| fig-cap: "Training Videos"

```

# Preparing a ProPresenter Playlist

The playlist is the list of visual elements that we need to present during the service. It will follow very closely the cue sheet that comes from Planning Centre Online (PCO).

There are two ways of doing this, the easiest way is to have ProPresenter create the playlist from PCO. They other way is to do it manually. Most of the time you will use the first option.

Early in the week the service cue sheet for the following Sunday will be distributed via Planning Center Online. With that in hand, you can prepare the playlist which includes all announcements, song lyrics, and other supporting elements.

## Creating a Playlist from PCO

It is very rare that you won't create your playlist this way. After starting ProPresenter, find the "+" in the upper left corner next to "Library" @fig-sop_pco_playlist7_1

```{r sop_pco_playlist7_1, echo=FALSE}
#| label: fig-sop_pco_playlist7_1
#| fig-cap: Click on the "+"
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_pco_playlist7_1.jpg")
```

Then select "Planning Center Service...". @fig-sop_pco_playlist7_2
 
```{r sop_pco_playlist7_2, fig.pos="H" }
#| label: fig-sop_pco_playlist7_2
#| fig-cap: Select "New PCO Playlist"
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_pco_playlist7_2.jpg")
```

Next you will see a pop-up where you need to select the plan that you want to use for your playlist. You may need to scroll sideways to see the date. You may need to click on the grey arrow to see the list of services. @fig-sop_pco_playlist7_3

```{r sop_pco_playlist7_3  }
#| label:   fig-sop_pco_playlist7_3
#| fig-cap: Click on the desired date and then "Select"
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_pco_playlist7_3.jpg")
```

The playlist will now show up on the left hand side. If the names of the items in PCO match the names of items that are already in the library, they will be automatically linked to the playlist. If that is incorrect, you can unlink it. 

If a Song is new, you will have to add it. See @sec-songs for more details.

If you created the playlist before Sunday, you should refresh the playlist on Sunday morning to collect any updates. After doing a refresh check to make sure your arrangement choices haven't been changed. @fig-sop_pco_playlist7_4
 
```{r sop_pco_playlist7_4 , fig.pos="H" }
#| label: fig-sop_pco_playlist7_4
#| fig-cap: Refresh a PCO playlist
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_pco_playlist7_4.jpg")
```


A PCO generated playlist remains linked to PCO. Items that were defined in PCO cannot be deleted or re positioned, you can add additional items.

If you need more flexibility, you can convert a PCO playlist to a manual one. @fig-sop_pco_playlist7_5

```{r sop_pco_playlist7_5 }
#| label: fig-sop_pco_playlist7_5
#| fig-cap: Convert to a non-PCO playlist
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_pco_playlist7_5.jpg")
```

## Importing Powerpoint

ProPresenter is able to import the contents of a PowerPoint presentation. It creates a ProPresenter document containing static images, which means any animations and transition affects that were part of the PowerPoint are lost. You also need to ensure that any special fonts used in the PowerPoint are installed on the system prior to importing the presentation.

You execute the import via File \> Import \> Import PowerPoint. @fig-sop-ppt-import-1

```{r sop-ppt-import-1 }
#| label: fig-sop-ppt-import-1
#| fig-cap: Importing a PowerPoint
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_ppt_import7_1.jpg")
```

and then navigate to the PowerPoint file. @fig-sop-ppt-import-2

```{r sop-ppt-import-2 }
#| label: fig-sop-ppt-import-2
#| fig-cap: Import
#| fig.retina: 2
#| cap-location: bottom

include_graphics("./images/sop_ppt_import7_2.jpg")
```

Once the import is complete, you can then link the new document to the playlist.
Once positioned in the playlist ensure that the correct content and lighting cues are set. (See @sec-macros)

Sometimes this import process doesn't work. If it seems to be breaking, then open PowerPoint directly. When you do that, there may be mesages from PowerPoint that need attention, like a notice of an update. Once those are cleared, you can retry the import process.

You can also do the PowerPoint Export completely outside of ProPresenter and export all slides as images, create a new ProPresenter document for them, and drag and drop all the saved JPGs into the document. This takes more effort to do, so you would only do it this way if the regular import doesn't work. It is also useful to do when moving a PowerPoint from a different machine and you want to ensure all fonts are rendered correctly.(The export would be performed on the source computer.)

## Video Loop Controls

When adding a video to a presentation, ProPresenter will be default make the video loop. This is good for motion background videos, but not what we want for videos like announcements, bumpers and video feature segments. 

::: {.callout-important}
You need to make sure that the loop property is set correctly. 
:::

How this is to be done depends on how the video was adding to the playlist. The two different results are illustrated in @fig-sop-pro7-loop-1

#. if the video was dropped directly onto the playlist on the left, it appears as a small thumbnail with a big play button beside it (first example).
#. if the a new presentation was created, and the video was dropped into the presentation, it appears as a big thumbnail (second exampe).

::: {.callout-tip}
The second method is preferred because you can add macros to the slide which you cannot do with the first method.
:::

!["Two Ways Videos Can Appear in the Playlist"](./images/sop-pro7-loop-1.jpg){#fig-sop-pro7-loop-1 width=50% }

To change the loop setting, you need to use the *inspector* which is located in different locations depending on the method used. See the orange arrows in @fig-sop-pro7-loop-1 .

On the second tab on the *inspector*, there is a dropdown for *playback*. We need to change that from *loop* to *stop* for a featured video, @fig-sop-pro7-loop-2  
 
!["Changing playback setting in *inspector*"](./images/sop-pro7-loop-2.jpg){#fig-sop-pro7-loop-2 width=50% }

## Songs {#sec-songs}

To add a song you

## Scripture

## Themes

## Looks

# Stage Display

ProPresenter gives us the ability to display other content on the rear display for the stage team to see that is different from what the audience sees. Since it helps give them confidence, it is sometimes called the confidence display as well.

::: {.callout-tip}
Once the a Stage Display Layout is selected, it will not change until you set it to something else. The *Content* macros set the stage display according to the content.
:::

The Stage display layouts can be edited using the "Edit Layouts" option on the "Screens" menu. @fig-sop_stage_layouts

![Editing Stage Layouts](./images/sop_stage_layouts.jpg){#fig-sop_stage_layouts width=50%} 

## Lyrics on Stage Display Only

We have a dedicated *Content* Macro for this purpose, "*Content Solo*".  Simply drop this macro on the first slide for which you don't want the lyrics to be displayed. This uses a *Look* to turn off the slide layer on all outputs but leave the media layer on. When you want to show lyrics again, using a different *Content* macro, for example *Content Song TW*, will select a different look.  

# Macros

Macros provide a way of combining a bunch of actions together to be executed as a group. We have two main types of macros. Macros that provide the settings for a particular type of content (prefix *content*) and another set of macros for lighting cues (prefix *Lq*).

Content Macros

:   These macros set the look and stage display that is most appropriate for the type of content. The looks may also override the theme applied to the text formatting. See @fig-sop_macro_content

![Sample Content Macros](./images/sop_macro_content.jpg){#fig-sop_macro_content  width=50%}

Lighting Macros

: Lighting cues set a prop and the automation program (CueCommanderNR - see @sec-cuecommander) will clear that cue. The lighting cue that is fired is derived from the name of the prop. See @fig-sop_macros_lighting

![Sample Lighting Macros](./images/sop_macros_lighting.jpg){#fig-sop_macros_lighting width=50%}

"Special" Light Cues

: There are 10 predefiend macros (and Props) for use as a spceical. For example, special lighting for a song. These are numbered Lq:80.0 through Lq:89.0. To use them, record your lighting look as a the corresponding numbered cue on the lighting console.

Series Standard Lighting Cues

: The are named Lq:90.0 through Lq:99.9. There is a light cue that corresponds to the type of content.

Colour Themed Light Cues

: Light cues Lq:100.0 through Lq:899.9 are reserved for light cues that correspond to different colour combinations, suitable to accompany music. The numbers correspond to major colours, see table @fig-digit-convention .

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Cue Name Digit Convention"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| label: fig-digit-convention

tribble(
	~Digit, ~Colour,
	1, "Red",
	2, "Green",
	3, "Blue",
	4, "Yellow",
	5, "Cyan",
	6, "Magenta/Pink",
	7, "White",
	8, "Orange/Amber"
) |>
	gt() |>
	opt_stylize(style=3) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "red") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 1) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "green") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 2) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "blue") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 3) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "yellow") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 4) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "cyan") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 5) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "magenta") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 6) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "white") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 7) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "orange") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit" , rows = Digit == 8) ) |>
	tab_style( style = list(  cell_text(weight = "bold") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Digit",  rows = everything() ) )
```

A light cue of Lq:140.0 would be defined to have a main colour of red (#1) and a secondary colour of yellow (#4). For more details, see the **System Operations Lighting** guide.

# How We Organize our files

## OneDrive service_media

The service_media directory is contains the short term content and provide a means for content creators to contribute content remotely. There are three main directory types that will be found here and they follow a name pattern:

Week Specific (eg. serv_feb12)

:   Within 'service_media' there would be a folder like serv_feb12. This is used for content that is specific to that date only. The powerpoint for the date, Announcement videos for that date, etc. Anything placed in those folders should be considered delete-able after the event has finished. If it is to be reused for a few weeks, it should be copied to the appropriate weeks, or placed in the series folder.

media_assets

:   This directory holds content meant to be reused long term. This includes things like uac logos and branding files.
Series Folder (Eg. series_jesus)

:   This is for graphics and media which are to be used for an entire message series. It contains the centre screen graphic, the lower 3rd graphics for video, the series Welcome graphic, bumper video, plus other useful backgrounds.

When we start a new series, we need to update several things in ProPresenter:

-   "Welcome" document
-   "Series Graphic" in "Props"
-   "Bumper"
-   Update the colours on the name and name+title themes and looks

## Media Resources

This is our main graphic library, for both still and motion graphics. There are some folders which are orgnized by a particular graphical theme (eq baptisms). And others which are organized by the source from which it was downloaded.

Many files have keywords in the file names that make them easier to search for. For example, you can search

-   by colour, eg "red",
-   or by content, eg "cross",
-   or format, eg "-tw" for triplewide content.

There are two main locations to look for graphics:

#. "CMG Graphics". These have all been downloaded for http://churchmotiongraphics.com . You can also go to that website and browse for something specific.
#. "Procontent" - these have been downloaded from https://procontent.renewedvision.com . You can also go there to browse. 




# Running Triple Wide

The ProPresenter projection output is a triple wide configuration. That is three HD images (1920x1080) side by side for a total of 5760x1080 pixels. ProPresenter knows that the projected image is divided up into three projection outputs. 

::: {.callout-note}
ProPresenter uses the terms *Screen*s and *Output*s very specifically. 

*Output*
: A video signal that ProPresenter sends out to a display device, for example an HDMI, SDI, or NDI display device.
*Screen*
: A collection of one or more *Output*s which either show identical content, which it calls a *Mirror*ed screen, or glued together so that content can span across multiple *Output*s, ProPresenter calls this a *Group*ed screen.  
:::
 
Our Front three projectors are each separate *Output*s. The are then used to define two different *Screen*s:

TW_Group
: A *Screen* which groups the three *Output*s into a large horizontal canvas across which images and videos span. See @fig-sop-pro7-tw-group for how it is defined and  @fig-tw-group-abc for an illustration of a possible display.

TW_Mirror
: A *Screen* which defines the three *Output*s as displays which are each to show identical content. See See @fig-sop-pro7-tw-mirror for how it is defined and  @fig-tw-mirror-aaa for an illustration of a possible display.

![Group Screen Definition](./images/sop-pro7-tw-group.png){#fig-sop-pro7-tw-group width=50%}

![Mirror Screen Defintion](./images/sop-pro7-tw-mirror.png){#fig-sop-pro7-tw-mirror  width=50%}

Looks are used to control which *Screen* is sent output. (If both screens are sent output at the same time it can look weird).

Examples of Group versus Mirror displays:

![Display using a Group Configuration](./images/sop-TW-Group-ABC.png){#fig-tw-group-abc}

![Display using a Mirror Configuration](./images/sop-TW-Mirror-AAA.png){#fig-tw-mirror-aaa}

# Projectors

## Turning the Front projectors On and Off

The power for the projectors can be operated via the web page for each projector.

If one or more of the front projectors does not repsond via the web page, you can use the Sony remote control. You need to stand below each screen and point the remote at the projector. The swtich on the remote needs to be set to **A** for the east screen, **B** for the centre screen, and **C** for the west screen.

## Turning the Rear Projector On and Off

The remote (Hitachi) for the balcony rear projector (aka confidence projector) is found near the computer monitor. To power off this projector you need to hit the off button twice.

# Operating the Matrix Video Switch

The matrix switch (ZVKU-A001) manages the routing of most video sources to various destinations. There are two ways to change the routing:

-   Via the matrix's web page
-   Via the front panel buttons

**Via the Web Page**

The matrix settings can be adjusted using its web page. There is a shortcut to it in Safari's bookmarks, or use [this - http://192.168.0.184](http://192.168.0.184).

On the page, click the output you want to change, and the input you want to tie it to. There is a little number in the output box which tells you which input it is tied to. The screen will go black for a few seconds while it makes the change.

**Via Front Panel Buttons**

You can do a similar thing directly on the front panel of the switch itself using the OUT and IN buttons. The unit is located under the desk near the computer.

![Matrix Video Swtich](./images/sop-gear-vs88dt-1.jpg)

## Camera On-screen Configuration

One common configuration is to get a camera image on the screen - usually the centre screen. The best method of achieving this is :

-   On the Video Matrix: for output **2**, select ATEM Aux (input **7**) See @fig-sop-matrix-camera-onscreen
-   On the ATEM Aux output, select the Aux feed to come from the Program bus 

With this configuration, what ever the video operator chooses for camera shots will be shown on the centre screen. 

![Matrix Configuration for On Screen Camera](./images/sop-matrix-camera-onscreen.png){#fig-sop-matrix-camera-onscreen  width=50%}

::: {.callout-important}
TODO - Need to work out the best way or routing the centre output to the ATEM so the video operator can route either the Program Bus or the Centre output to the Aux Bus. This way the video operator can make a very smooth transition between the two.
:::

# Remote Login

Rather than having to come to the church to prepare the playlist, we offer the ability to login remotely. More than one person can do this at the same time which allows two people to see exactly the same thing and work together - this is helpful for training or assistance.

To use the remote tool, you need to start with a web browser. Some work better than others. The preference is:

-   Firefox
-   Chrome
-   Internet Explorer / Safari.

1.  The address to get started is: https://remoteassist.neysh.ca/ .
2.  Click on "login" on the right side.

!["Starting with the web page"](./images/sop-remote-01.jpg){height="3in"}

3.  You will be provided with a userid and password separately.
4.  Please do your best to protect this password from being compromised.
5.  Click login

!["Logging into the Service"](./images/sop-remote-02.jpg){height="3in"}

6.  if you see uacAVtech here you know you are logged in to the service.
7.  click on "Host"

!["Selecting the Host Tab"](./images/sop-remote-03.jpg){height="3in"}

8.  Select this entry in the access list.
9.  There are several computers on the list, you want "CDMU-A001", click in the checkbox.
10. Then click "Join"

!["Selecting the Host Tab"](./images/sop-remote-04.jpg){height="3in"}

The first time in you will need to select one of these options which will install addtional components on your system. Try "Windows Selector" first (on a windows machine), otherwise "ClickOnceDirect" or "WebStartBootstrap".

!["Selecting the Correct Launcher"](./images/sop-remote-05.jpg){height="3in"}

Once logged into CDMU-A001 you will see all the displays that this computer has configured, you will want to use the view menu to select the primary display so you have a decent screen size to work with.

# Trouble Shooting

## Filter needs cleaning

: Please advise Terry.

## Video mixer (ATEM) sees only a black image for the ProPresenter input

The problem:

-   The computer was awaken before the ATEM was fully powered on. 

Recovery:

-   Option A:
    -   Reboot the Mac (CDMA-A001). 
-   Option B: (not fully documented)
    -   Quit ProPresenter
    -   On the Mac, open the SwitcherX settings application
    -   Go to the Custom resolutions tab
    -   Select any video mode, and apply
    -   Select the 1080p60 mode. And apply.
    -   The mac video system will reset.
    -   Restart ProPresenter.

Option B is likely the fastest and least disruptive approach. The duration of the disruption will be from when you apply the correct resolution until ProPresenter fully restarts.

## Projectors don't respond to the web page request (to turn on or off)

The problem:

-   Network trouble

Recovery:

-   Use the grey Sony remote controls to turn them on.
-   You need to be pretty much directly below each projection screen and point the remote at the projector. One remote will do all three but you will have to change the selector switch for each projector (not sure if the switch is labelled 1,2,3 or A,B,C.) The east screen is the "first" ( A or 1).
