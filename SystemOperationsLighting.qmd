# Introduction

This document provides basic operating information for Lighting systems for the auditorium at Unionville Alliance Church.

Purpose of the lighting system:

* Necessary to help the hearing impaired ( roughly 10% of the population) to lip read
* Supports video recording
* Helps draw attention to the central item – conversely makes it easier to ignore clutter
* Helps audience to focus and concentrate
* Reinforces the message (spoken or sung)

There are two mechanisms to control the lighting: 

* A keypad located on the main floor by the south east auditorium doors. Users can select one of several preset configurations. 
* For more sophisticated control there is a lighting control console located in the balcony (an ETC ColorSource 40AV console).  It can be used for all lighting operations, especially more sophisticated lighting designs than can be accomplished via the keypad panel.

# Operating the Keypad

There is a simple lighting control panel located next to the auditorium doors by the main office (south east). See @fig-sol-keypad . It enables the house lights to set according to several pre-defined looks, of which there are 8.   Selecting one preset, deselects the previous preset - just like old fashion car radio buttons. The current list of available presets is found in @fig-keypad-presets

The keypad and the main console can conflict with each other. When running from the console, the keypad must be in "Console Mode".  (You won't harm any equipment by having the keypad in the wrong mode, but the system will not work properly!)

The "Night Light" preset should be selected when the room is not in use.

A button turns blue when it is selected, orange otherwise.

The sconce lights also have an timed switch which is next to the keypad, **if you want sconce control during the day you will need to manual turn them on as well**. The timer is programmed to turn on the sconse lights during the evening hours (up to midnight), and Sunday morning.

# Lighting Power Control

> This section needs to be rewritten post the 2018 upgrades.

## Power On

> TODO: This section needs to be rewritten. Picture needs to be replaced.

1. Turn on 'Furhman' unit under rear desk / east end - big red switch under the light board (and slightly to the right)
    + **As of the Fall 2017, this is to be left on at all times. This is temporary as I work through a configuration problem.**
2. Go to balcony closet
3. Turn on the main breakers at the top of the panel as indicated by the arrow and yellow box in the diagram below.

![The switch in the yellow box](./images/sol-BalconyPower2019.png){height=4in}


4. Turn on the lighting console (see diagram)

![Console Power](./images/sol-ETC-CS40AV-Power.png){height=3in}

5. Switch the keypad (by office doors) to "Console Mode".

## Power Off

To turn off, reverse the power on order and turn off.

> When leaving the system for the day ensure that lower level keypad is set to "Night Light" (The button will turn blue).

# Controlling the Lighting System

Basic operations of the house lights can be accomplished by using the keypad - which was discussed in the previous section.  

Advanced operations of house and theater lighting is accomplished via the lighting console in the balcony. See the section below for more details. **The keypad needs to be in "Console Mode" for this to work properly.**

We can also use ProPresenter to fire pre-defined cues via macros. Using this technique a macro can be placed on a slide within a ProPresenter document and when that slide is displayed, the macro will instruct the lighting console to change to the corresponding cue number. ProPresenter macros can also be fired directly from the macro menu.

{{< pagebreak >}} 
 
# Operating the ColorSource 40AV Console

This is the primary and most capable way of controlling (almost) all lighting in the auditorium. Simple operations are fairly simple and yet it is not too hard to create some sophisticated looks.  

* What cannot be controlled from the console? 
    + The balcony railing lights,   
    + The sconce light swtich (but if the sconce light switch is 'on' the console can control the sconce lights.) and, 
    + The emergency lighting is a completely independent system. It is activated when there is a power outage.

## Simple Console Operations

In our standard settings, we use the *playback* mode to run our basic scenes. You must be in playback mode for this to work. A quick check is to look at the numbered buttons below the faders; if they are a pale purple and green then you are in the right mode. 

There are two pages of playbacks. The on-screen button indicated by the arrow in the picture below will say "Playback 1" or "Playback 2". Touching the button selects the other page. You want Playback 1 most of the time. 

There is a button on the left side of the screen that you touch to select playback mode; the yellow arrow in the picture below points at it, see @fig-sol-cs40-playback .

![Playback Mode - The yellow arrow points at the button](./images/sol-cs40-playback.png){#fig-sol-cs40-playback}

Also the playback master must be up. It is the second slider from the left at the top of the screen. 

![Playback Master Fader - The arrow points at the Playback master slider](./images/sol-cs40av-pb-master.jpg){height=3in #fig-sol-cs40av-pb-master}

### Playback Map
```{r}
simplePlaybackCount <- playback %>%
    filter(IsSimple =="Y") %>%
    nrow()
```

There are `r simplePlaybackCount` playbacks that are useful for simple operations. The first three listed (#8,9 and 10) are for the absolute most basic functions. See @fig-playbacks

The remaining playbacks listed are the first 5 sliders (#21-#26) on the bottom row. They are programmed to looks that are useful for a simple service. These sliders (as well as others) can be used in combination to build a look.

```{r simple}
#| fig-cap: "Playbacks"
#| fig-cap-location: bottom
#| label: fig-playbacks
#| 
playback |>
  #arrange(Playback) %>%
  filter(IsSimple =="Y") |>
  select(-IsSimple) |>
  gt() |>
  opt_stylize(style=3) |>
  tab_style( style = list(  cell_text(weight = "bold") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = "Playback"  ) )	|>
  tab_style( style = list( cell_fill(color = "grey") ),
    locations = cells_body(  columns = everything() , rows = Playback %in% c(8,9, 10)) ) 

#  kable() %>%
#  column_spec( 1,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
#  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE) %>%
#  row_spec(1:3, bold=T, background = "lightgrey")
```


## Intermediate Console Operations

The other playback faders are used to control individual groups of lights. The first six have a designated special purpose for sound triggers.

There are terms used in these descriptions to describe areas of the room that you need to know. Not all of these will neccessarily be installed or available at any given point in the future. A common example is that we typically remove the Towers from operation for a baptism service due to the proximity of the fixtures and water.

House
: All Pendants plus the under balcony pot lights (not including the stage pots)

Sconce
: The wall mounted fixtures that light the outer aisles

Stage Pots
: The lights recessed mounted into the ceiling of the stage

Wall Wash
: These are the ceiling mounted perimeter light bars that wash down the walls including the bulkhead sideways wash.

Towers
: These are wide pillars of light that wash up the walls beside the screens using lightbars

Flares
: similar in location to the towers, these are cone shaped lights which can be used to provide a contrasting overlay to the towers. The lights used for this (ColorSource PARs) can be repourposed for other features.

Lightbars
: We have bar-like lighting fixtures in several spots, and in addtion we have six bars that we use for feature lighting.

Thrust
: The portable steps/platform in front of the main stage.

Scrims
: A screen or a backdrop used on stage - often backlit.

Top Wash
: A light the illuminates people from directly overhead.

Most of these have a group of three playbacks that are programmed for RGB. This provides an easy way to set the colour of that entire group by adjsuting the relative blend of red, green and blue. Alternately you can select the channels and pick a colour using the colour chips.

The House, has only one slider which is straight white. This is a quick way of getting to white for that group. The Stage Pots have a straight white plus RGB sliders.

>Note: if during the service there is a fire alarm, bring all house lights to full white. 

In addtion to the 9 playbacks used for simple opertions covered earlier, the playbacls in the list below can be used for quick color mixing.

> <large>TODO: **The list below is out of date and needs to be updated.**</large>

playback %>%
  filter(IsSimple == "N"  ) %>%
#  arrange(Playback) %>%
  select(-IsSimple) %>%

  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

# Blinds and Shades

We have two ways of controlling the light that enters the sanctuary via the exterior windows: semi-transparent shades and blackout blinds.

### Shade Operation

The semi-transparent shades are operated manually. There is a chrome chain in each window which runs the shade up or down.  

### Blind Operation

The blackout blinds operate as four banks of three blinds (one bank per wall). The switches are under the rear desk near the east end.
They are labelled: SE, NE, SW, and NW, which stands for the combinations of South, East, North and West.

Each switch has three positions: up, center and down. The up and down positions move the blinds in that direction. Centre is ‘off’, but does not stop a blind mid-way. When a blind is set to move in a direction it will do so until it is fully up or fully down. There are internal limit switches that will stop the blind at the limit. The switch does not have to be returned to the centre position.

To stop a blind mid-way while travelling, momentarily flick the switch in the opposite direction and then return the switch to the centre position. If you pause too long in the opposite direction the blind will reverse direction rather than stop.

**When the service is over, please ensure that the blackout blinds are all the way up. If left down for long periods of time in the bright daylight, heat builds up between the blind and the window and the blind deforms and pops out of the track.**

{{< pagebreak >}} 

# Troubleshooting   

If a blackout blind pops out of its track. 
: Running the blinds up and down a **little** bit at a time can sometimes get them back in their track. An assistant at the blind can reach in behind and help guide them in. If it is more than a few inches, a ladder may be required to reinsert the blind into the track.


If the lighting console playbacks do not seem to work
: 1) Verify that the keypad is in console mode
: 2) Verify that you are in playback mode 
: 3) Verify that you are on the right playback page (#2)
: 4) Verify that the playback master is up. See Instructions in the Simple Console Operations section. 
: execute 'Clear all' - which will put you into black.

If the lights are on and the console doesn't seem to have control
: check the playback verifications above
: Verify that the console has some control by turining something else on. If that works then it is likely that a keypad preset is forcing the lights on. 
: Go to the keypad on press "Console Mode".
: execute 'Clear all' - which will put you into black.

The "User Manual" is available on the [manufacturer's website](https://www.etcconnect.com/Support/Consoles/ColorSource/Documentation.aspx) 

## The Functions of Light

Stage lighting has multiple functions, including:

Selective visibility
: The ability to see what is occurring on stage. Any lighting design will be ineffective if the viewers cannot see the characters, unless this is the explicit intent.

Revelation of form
: Altering the perception of shapes onstage, particularly three-dimensional stage elements.

Focus
: Directing the audience's attention to an area of the stage or distracting them from another.

Mood
: Setting the tone of a scene. Harsh red light has a different effect than soft lavender light.

Location and time of day
: Establishing or altering position in time and space. Blues can suggest night time while orange and red can suggest a sunrise or sunset. Use of mechanical filters ("gobos") to project sky scenes, the Moon, etc.

Projection/stage elements
: Lighting may be used to project scenery or to act as scenery onstage.
Plot (script): A lighting event may trigger or advance the action onstage and off.

Composition
: Lighting may be used to show only the areas of the stage which the designer wants the audience to see, and to "paint a picture".

Effect
: In pop and rock concerts or DJ shows or raves, colored lights and lasers may be used as a visual effect.

## The Qualities of Light

There is a series of videos on these topics on Right now media. Search for or click on:

### Intensity

The intensity of a luminaire (lighting instrument or fixture) depends on a number of factors including its lamp power, the design of the instrument (and its efficiency), optical obstructions such as colour gels or mechanical filters, the distance to the area to be lit and the beam or field angle of the fixture, the colour and material to be lit, and the relative contrasts to other regions of illumination.

### Color

Every color has some kind of emotion tied to it, and color is just one way that we can express mood. There are some generally accepted relationships between moods and feelings and basic colors:

Red
: Anger, fear, jealousy, hot, fire

Pink
: Love, light, delicate, love

Yellow
: Exciting, bright, flashy, cheerful

Amber
: Awakening, morning, raw, rustic

Green
: Organic, calming, natural, mysterious

Purple
: Regal, powerful, majesty
 
Aqua
: Gentle, simple, water

Blue
: Water, night, calm, cool, somber

White
: Open, raw

This is a very simplified way of sharing moods with you, as there are so many more shades that each have their own character and moods. For example faster songs tend to go best in red, yellow, or other bright colors, and slower songs look great in blues, purples and greens.

There are entire books written on colour theory and their emotional effects. We also have the ability to mix colours together which adds even more nuance to our decisions. You can choose a completely monochromatic theme, say varied shades of blue, or a 2-colour combo using complimentary colours, such as blue and yellow, or Triadic colors, which are like complementary colors, but in a triangle across the color wheel.

Whatever your colour choices, it is best if there is agreement between the lighting colours and the colours used in the video backgrounds.

### Focus

The focus is where an instrument is pointed. The final focus should place the "hot spot" of the beam at the actor's head level when standing at the centre of the instrument's assigned "focus area" on the stage. 

Position refers to the location of an instrument in the auditroium. Hanging is the act of placing the instrument in its assigned position.

### Beam

Beam refers to the shape, quality and evenness of a lamp's output. The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by a number factors about the instruments design.

Some instruments can have a gobo or break up pattern installed. This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. Gobos, or templates, come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.

# Lighting Terminology

Channel
: In the context of lighting at UAC, a channel is a configuration item in the colorSource console. It controls one to many DMX addresses. If the console knows what kind of instrument a channel is assigned to, it is automatically configured for the correct behaviours (colour, strobe, etc). 

Dimmer
: A device which regulates the power sent to a lighting instrument (typically incandescent) this allows the intensity of the instrument to be varied. Usually DMX controlled, but could be controlled via an analog or proprietary protocols.

DMX / DMX512
: an industry standard lighting control protocol. A universe is a group of 512 addresses, numbered 1 through 512. See also RDM. 

Gel
: a coloured sheet of special plastic which is used to physically change the colour of a light. 

Gel Frame
: a metal or heat-resistant cardboard frame to hold a Gel and slips into a slot on the lighitng instrument.

Gobo
: a pattern, usually made from thin metal or glass, which enables a lighting instrument to project a pattern. It usually slips in a Gobo frame which slides into the instrument. 

Incandescent
: a method of producing light by heating a filament (thin wire) inside a glass bulb. A standard old-fashioned lightbulb is incandescent. See Also LED.

LED / Light Emitting Diode
: A technology that generates lighting from a solid state device rather than a hot piece of wire (incandecent). An LED instrument also typically has a built-in dimming and control. They typically use 3 to 5 DMX channels. See also Incandescent.

Par / Par Can
: a type of lighting instrument with a fixed beam width. Some of them look like paint cans. Generally used for washes.

RDM / Remote Device Management
: This is a management protocol that can run over the same cables as DMX. It is a bi-directional protocol. It can be used to change the configuration of some lighting fixtures (such as our ETC fixtures) without having physical access to the fixture.

Rotator
: a device which spins a Gobo. Usually Inserted into a lighting instrument where the Gobo holder would go. 

Top Hat
: a light modifier added to the front of a lighting instrument to narrow its beam spread.
