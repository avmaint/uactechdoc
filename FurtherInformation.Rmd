# Further Information

There are several types of documents available.

```{r}
chart <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Description,
"System Operations Documents",
"How to operate each subsystem.",

"System Design Documents",
"Subsystem deep dive. Where components are located, how configured, and wired. A regular operator does not normally need to know this level of detail - until there is a problem.",

"Administration Documents",  
"Information related to credentials (accounts, userids, and passwords), and what you need to know to manage those." ,

"Manuals",
"These are publications from the manufactures of the equipment we have."
)
 
tab <- chart |>

		opt_stylize(style = 3) |>
	    opt_row_striping(  row_striping = TRUE) |>
		tab_style( style = cell_text( 	weight = "bold",  	),
		        	locations = cells_body(  	columns = "Type") )  
```

```{r fi-image, results='asis'}
cat(print_gt_table(tab))
```

There is an operations and a design guide for each of the major subsystems.  

```{r fifurther, asis=FALSE}
 #| tbl-cap: "Index to Other Documents"
 #| cap-location: bottom
 
further |>
  mutate (Operations = ifelse(is.na(Operations),"", glue('[X]({Operations})') ),
