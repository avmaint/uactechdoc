#Introduction
This document provides key technical documentation design for the lighting subsystems at UAC. The intended audience of thsi document are the people who need to manage and maintain the system. 

Purpose of the lighting system:

* Necessary to help the hearing impaired ( roughly 10% of the population) to lip read
* Supports video recording
* Helps draw attention to the central item â€“ conversely makes it easier to ignore clutter
* Helps audience to focus and concentrate
* Reinforces the message (spoken or sung)

There are two mechanisms to control the lighting: 

* A touch panel located on the main floor by the south east auditorium doors. Users can select one of several preset configurations. 
* For more sophisticated control, The primary lighting control console  is an ETC ColorSource 40AV console.  It is used for all lighting operations more sophisticated than can be accomplished via the touchpad panel.

# Control Systems

There are two different protocols used to control the lighting levels of our major auditorium lighting systems: 

* DMX, which is the backbone protocol. We use only one DMX universe for output.
* and KetraNet Mesh wireless

How these systems are interconnected is depcited on the diagrams below. 

The handrail lighting in the balcony and the emergency lighting are independent systems. 

### DMX Topology
The console is protected from power surges via an opto-isolator/DMX splitter.


```{r top1}

selected.at <- c( "ZLKU-C001", "ZLIP-0001", "CDWU-0009",

    arrange( AssetTag ) %>%
    kable(align="l") %>%
    column_spec( 1,  bold = TRUE ) %>%
    kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

##Keypad Topology Control

There is a simple lighting control panel located next to the auditorium doors by the main office (south east). It enables the house lights to set according to several pre-defined looks. 

The keypad and the main console work together. The controls are added together; brightest wins. This means than if either control says a ligth is on, it will be on. 

> as of Oct 25, these have not yet been programmed. There are some blanks available. 

> The sconce lights has a timed switch which is next to the keypad, if you want sconce control during the day you will need to manual turn them on as well.

```{r keypadtop}
DiagrammeR::grViz("sdl-topology2-keypad.gv")
```

The lighting instruments which are hung from the balcony bars cannot be controlled from the keypad due to the point in the topology where unison and dmx are merged.

The programming is managed via the Echo Access app which communicates via bluetooth. There is a configuration menu item in the app. There are three items that each contribute to the configuration.

> TODO: add commentary before each of the following lists.

> TODO: Verify Profile and may need to split bulkhead ADJ zone into a colour zone and an Intensity Zone.

> TODO: Fill in the details of the tasks which can be accomplished via each of these three sections.

Access BT Interface
: The second page is where you assign names

Inspire 8 Button
: Associates Button actions to presets.

> TODO: need to define behaviours for: single click, double click, press and hold.

DMX Scene Controller
: The second page is where the ZONE defintions are managed, including the DMX assignments and the instrument footprint (RGB, IRGBS, etc).

The app also allows for direct control of the presets.

```{r getKeypadData}
keypad <-  get_keypad_buttons() 
keypad2preset <- get_keypad2preset()
preset2zone   <- get_preset2zone()
zones2dmx     <- get_zones2dmx()
```

```{r keypad}
keypad %>%
  arrange(Button) %>%
  kable() %>%
  column_spec( 1,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE) %>%
    row_spec(1:nrow(keypad), color="blue")
```
 
Control of the ADJ Ultrabar 12 devices on the walls presents a challenge. These are configured as 12 address devices. This DMX footprint is not directly supported by the echo equipment.  The workaround is to split these into a colour and Intensity zone.  

>Note: Any one DMX address can only belong to one Zone.
 
```{r zoneConfig}
#Zones to DMX mappings
zones2dmx %>%
  arrange(Zone) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)  %>%
    row_spec(1:nrow(zones2dmx), color="blue")
```


```{r configReport}
rs <- keypad %>%
  merge(keypad2preset) %>%
  merge(preset2zone )

require(sqldf)  
rs <- sqldf("Select Button, Name, Preset, z.Zone, B_Description, Z_Description, Details 
            from zones2dmx as z, rs as rs 
            where z.Zone = rs.Zone
            ")
# no idea why merge didn't work!
```

This table defines the detailed programming for each Button, Preset and Zone. 

```{r}
rs %>%  
  arrange(Button, Zone) %>%
  kable() %>%
  #column_spec( 1,   bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE  ) %>%
    row_spec(1:nrow(rs), color="blue")
```

These white only strip lights are dimmable and are manually operated. The swtich is located near the East balcony door.

#House Lighting - NEW as of Fall 2018
The house lights consists for many major components:


    
##Control
The house lights (except the railing) can be controlled in two ways:
 
#. Via the keypad panel 
    * Located at the front of the auditorium, office side.
    * Allows the selection of one of eight preset scenes.

#. Via the Colorsource 40AV console
    * Located in the balcony on th erear desk.
    * many sophisticated looks can be programmed into the console.

The commands from these two control points are added together. Essentially the brightest level from either control dicates the brightness of any light. 
    
>TODO: need to add discussion about the sconse light and the interaction between the 3-way switch, timer and touchpad.    
    
##Programming

> TBD - how to program the touchpad scenes.

#Ketra Design - Stage

```
Ketra S38 product comes in `r nrow(products)` different beam angles:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
products %>% formattable(align="l")
```
For the pots on the west side of the stage I have measured the position of each pot (give or take an inch or three). The east side is taken as the mirror image. This is a pretty good assumption but there is at least one notable exception; one pot is out of place and the stage is not symmetrical. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

# use the tan rule as above, convert from radians to degrees
angle = atan(rise/run) *(180/pi)
```

The design has divided up the design into `r plan %>% select(group) %>% unique() %>% count()` zones. Each group would be controlled by its own DMX channel group.

## Walls  
We need to keep the light off the screens so we need to use the spot width lamps next to the walls. With nothing else added, these will create dots on the floor.
```{r echo=FALSE}
p1 <- plan %>% 
   filter(group == "Wall" ) 

makeplot(p1 )

#p1 %>% select(-rads, -Î¸ ) %>% formattable()
```
[goto top](#TOC)

## Down Stage (Bulkhead)
The bulkhead pots can be used to light up the typical vocal area. An eight foot beam diameter should give decent coverage. With all of them on, the centre section wil be brighter than the outside.

For coverage behind the bulkhead, we can use "Two Rows"

```{r echo=FALSE}
p1 <- plan %>% 
   filter(group == "Down Stage" ) 

makeplot(p1 )

#p1 %>% select(-rads, -Î¸ ) %>% formattable()
```
[goto top](#TOC)

The WF covers most of the riser  

```{r echo=FALSE}

makeplot(p1 )

#p1 %>% select(-rads, -Î¸ ) %>% formattable()
```
[goto top](#TOC)

## Centre Wash

The there are 10 centre pots are in one groups to wash most of the platform. There will be a hot spot down the centre if all are on at once.


```{r echo=FALSE}
p1 <- plan %>% 
   filter(group == "Centre"  )   

makeplot(p1)

#p1 %>% select(-rads, -Î¸ ) %>% formattable()

##Transition Delay
The systems supports several profiles:

* RGB  - Red, Green, Blue 
* RGBW - RGB plus White
* RGBIF - RGB plus Intensity and Fade Time

The maximum delay time required to execute a lighting transition follows this formula:
$$
T = 2.7 \times {ceiling} (  \frac {N \times G} {45})
$$
where:

```{r}
df <- tribble (
  ~Variable, ~Description, ~Value,
   "",      "Number of groups on Stage", g1 <-4,
   "",      "Number of groups in House", g2 <-7,
   "G",     "Total number of groups",    G  <-(g1+g2),
   "N",     "Number of (DMX) Channels per Group", N <- 3,
  "T",     "Maximum delay time", T <- 2.7 * ceiling(N*G/45)
)

df %>% kable() %>%
  column_spec( 1 ,  bold = TRUE ) %>%
  kable_styling("striped", full_width = TRUE)
```

In this design there are `r G`  groups all using the RGB profile. The expected maximum transition time is `r T` seconds.

## GOBO Rotators
>Needs to be updated. DMX info is out-of-date.

Each one needs two channels.

* n is a control channel, n+1 must be zero.

Intensity of zero is stop. The closer to 50 the slower it rotates. 1-49 and 50-100 rotate in opposite directions.
