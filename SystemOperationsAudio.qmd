# Introduction
This document provides basic operating information for each of the Audio systems at UAC.

Purpose of our Sound System:

* Necessary to help the hearing impaired ( roughly 10% of the population) 
* Supports video recording
* Helps draw attention to the central item – conversely makes it easier to ignore other noise 
* Helps audience to focus and concentrate
* Reinforces the message (spoken or sung)

# Power On and Off

## Power On
 
There are three numbered swtiches located in the balcony required to turn the system on

#. is located at the far west end of the front desk. This energizes the front desk gear.
#. is located behind the mix position at the top of the rack. This energizies the rear desk audio gear.
#. is just below #2. This energizes the audio amplifiers.

Allow a 10 second pause between flipping each switch.

After the console has fully started, you would typically want to recall the default scene so all settings are in a known good state.

:::{.callout-important}
As of 2023, we have a problem with the amplifier switch and the amplifiers must be turned on and off manually. 
:::

:::{.callout-note}
Although not part of the audio system, it is often the audio engineer who turns on portions of lighting (blue button) and video system (switch #4) as well
::: 
 
## Power Off 

Power off is the opposite sequence from power on.  Provide a 30 second pause between switch 3 and 2. This gives the power amps time to cycle off before proceeding.

# Basic Operations

## The Two Consoles

We have two audio consoles in the auditorium. The main console and a sub console to provide expanded input capacity.

Most vocal and stage instruments are wired into the main console (M7CL). Addtional inputs for wireless beltpacks, computers, and palyback machines come in via the sub console. The outputs of the sub console are routed into the corresponding busses of the main console.

The monitor mix busses on both consoles are numbered the same. 

Scene recall on the main console will cause the same numbered scene to be recalled on the sub console as well. 

## Scene Recall 

Scenes are a collection of settings that can be stored and recalled together. This is a very effective way of getting to a good known state. We have created a scene (**scene #014**) which should be used as a base for start an event. This scenes is locked so that they cannot be easily overwritten. If you would like to make a change to a base scene, please discuss with Terry.

When recalling a scene, whatever is being recalled will (almost) instantly become active or inactive. You __don't__ what to do this when live, unless you know exactly what you are doing.

__Scene 014__

To recall Scene 014, press the up/down keys until “Scene 014” flashes in the SCENE field. Then press the
[RECALL] key.

# Console Inputs

Part of what is included in the scene definition is the channel layout.  See @fig-m7cl-inputs and @fig-dm1k-inputs.

:::{.callout-note}
* Channels 41-48 will be reassigned sometime in 2023.
* BP06 is currently assigned to this range as well ... don't remember which channel.

## Operating a Channel

# Console Ooutputs

## Monitors

We have six monitor amplifier channels, each which can handle a load of two of our monitor wedges. 

Our standard monitor configuration is (@fig-monitors)

```{r gt.monitors}
#| label: fig-monitors
#| fig-cap: Standard Monitor Map
get_monitors() |>
	gt() |>
	tab_header("Standard Monitor Map") |>
	opt_stylize(style=3) 
```

## Effects

Busses 7, 8, 9 and 10 are used for routing a mix to the internal effects processor which then appears as inputs on the return faders. 

Bus 7
: The Post-fade mix is sent to a **plate reverb** processor which then appears on return channel 1.

Bus 8
: The Post-fade mix is sent to a **hall reverb** processor which then appears on return channel 2.

Bus 9
: The Post-fade mix is sent to a **delay** processor which then appears on return channel 3.

Bus 10
: The Post-fade mix is sent to a **chorus** processor which then appears on return channel 4.

## Dante Outputs

```{r dante_outputs}
#| label: fig-dante-outputs

	select(-Device) |>
	gt() |>
	tab_header("M7 Dante Outputs") |>
	opt_stylize(style=3)
```


## Other Busses
Bus 14 is used for recording. 
The Mono bus is used for lobby.

# Operating the Wireless Microphones

We have 18 wireless transmitters and 12 receivers. A receiver can only be paried with on transmitter at a time, which means we can have, at most 12 active transmitters.

Of the 18 transmitters, 12 are handheld microphones, and 6 are beltpack units that can be fitted with either a headset or lavalier microphone.

The six beltpack trasnmitters are all routed to the DM1K mixer, with BP06 also being routed to the M7CL as it is used by Ken for his vocal mic.

The 12 handheld transmitters are all routed to the M7CL to be used as for talking or singing.

__Battery Management__

Each trasnmitter takes two AA batteries. The battery level is visible on both the trasnmitter and the reciever displays. When using Duracell Coppertop batteries each 'segment' on the display indicates about 30 minutes of runtime, but never count on the last segment. In figure @fig-soa-battery1, channel 3 has about 1.5 hours of runtime and channel 4 has about 2 hours (5 segments minus one). 

The display on the microphone is similar.

![Receiver Display](./images/soa-battery1.png){#fig-soa-battery1}

Old batteries are to be discarded in the collection bin to the left of the console.

__Head Amp Gain__

The preamplifier gain cannot be controlled from the console. It is set via the buttons on the front panel of the receivers. This also means that the gain setting is not recalled with a scene recall.

__Wipe Down__

Wipe the microphone with a Lysol wipe before giving them to the people.

## Audio Recording - Audio CD

We don't do this normally but if desired this is how.

Key Steps:

#. Place a blank CD into the recorder and close the tray. It will take a few moments to recognize the disc type.
#. Press the Auto/Manual (or is it tracking) button on the left hand side to select whether you want new tracks created automatically or not.
#. Press the record button to begin recording
#. Press the record button again to start a new track when desired.
#. Press stop when done. The display will flash a PMA message for a few moments
#. To Finalize. 
    * Press the "Finalize" button, it will think for a moment or three and the display will show a time. (usually 2:01). 
    * Push Play and it will begin finalizing. The time will count down.
    * Eject disc, remove disc
    * Close tray.
#. If for some reason the audio CD was not finalized, put it back into the recorder and pick up the instructions at step #6.

## Terminology

# A hack - gt doesn't provide a means of line-breaking for pdf. So we create a graphic and then include the graphic.
